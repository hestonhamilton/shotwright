description: Drive the full bead loop end to end — claim, run the current R/P/I/V phase, advance through phases, and finish — pausing only at real decision boundaries. Use to work a bead (or several) with minimal prompting.

# flow

One command to run the bead workflow with the model in the driver's seat. It
chains the existing skills and stops only where a human decision is genuinely
required, so you are not hand-invoking `/bead-start` → `/rpiv` → `/bead-finish`
for every phase.

> Read `## Project config` in CLAUDE.md first (branch prefix, bd umbrella, verify
> command, `ENFORCEMENT`, `BEADS`). Honor every per-skill boundary below — `/flow`
> reduces prompting between steps, it does not remove the confirmation gates.

## Inputs

- Optional bead id — work that bead. Omitted: pick the first ready non-epic from
  `bd ready` (lowest available R/P/I/V phase within its epic).
- Optional `--once` — stop after the current phase instead of advancing.

## Loop

1. **Claim** — `/bead-start` for the chosen/next bead: claim it, auto-name and
   create the branch, scaffold the phase artifact.
2. **Run the phase** — `/rpiv` for the bead's current phase, under that phase's
   contract (R/P/I/V).
3. **Advance** — at a clean phase exit: verify the phase's acceptance is met, commit its
   artifact, and **close the current phase bead** (honoring the commit/`bd close` gates).
   Closing R and P here is required, not optional — the R/P/I/V children are
   dependency-chained, so the next phase's bead stays blocked (never becomes ready) until
   its predecessor is closed. Then transition to the next phase's bead and return to
   step 2. When an Implement phase is complete, go to step 4.
4. **Finish** — `/bead-finish`: verify against acceptance, propose a commit,
   optionally open a PR, close the bead.
5. **Next** — if ready work remains and `--once` was not given, return to step 1;
   otherwise stop and summarize what moved.

## Pause for confirmation (the only stops)

Carry over every boundary from the underlying skills — never bypass them:

- Ambiguous bead selection (only when the bead was not named explicitly).
- A foundational component/dependency choice, or an unresolved plan **Open
  Question** (`/rpiv`).
- Commit message wording, `git push`, `gh pr create`, `bd close` (`/bead-finish`).
- Any transition that changes a bead's acceptance criteria.

Between those, proceed without asking.

## Stop conditions

- Verification fails → stop at finish, report it, do not close.
- No ready work → summarize and stop.
- A boundary needs the owner → ask, then resume from the same step.
